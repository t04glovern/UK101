# UK101
Contains various basic code files taken from a family member of my partner who recently passed away. The code was originally written for the Compukit UK101 system but can be also be run on the Superboard II

For each file I have uploaded a `*.basic.original` and a `*.basic` file. Any changes to code code should be made in the `*.basic`, leaving the `*basic.original` files clean and unaltered.

At some stage I will upload high quality scans of all the code so other people can remember and enjoy it!
